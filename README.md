# RubySnippets

This is just a simple collection of snippets that I find myself using on a regular basis when working with Ruby & Rails projects in Sublime text.

Explore the directories within to see what snippets exist.

This is by no means a complete set of snippets. I will be adding to it as I find new things.

## Installation

This isn't in package control yet. Just clone the repository into your `~/Packages/User` folder and keep up to date using `git pull`.
